### Common Community Physics Package (CCPP) Echosystem
- CCPP is designated to facilitate implementation of physics innovations in state-of-the-art atmospheric models, the use of various models to develop physics, and the acceleration of transition of physics innovations to operational models. 
- There are two distinct parts to the CCPP: 
  - a library of physical parameterizations (CCPP-Physics) that conforms to selected standards, and an infrastructure (CCPP-Framework) that enables connecting the physics to a host model. 
  - There is also a CCPP single-column model (CCPP SCM) which is a simplified framework that enables experimentation in a controlled setting using forcing datasets originating from experimental field campaigns.
